# Components

I divided this project in components

### MainPanel

This component is the component that we will use as frame to put all the other components

+ #### InputComboModel ``Views/MainPanel/Components/InputComboModel``

 This is an **abstract class** used to create all boxes that contain pairs of input and action button
